## Abstract

A focused collection of organic synthesis reactions for computer-based
molecule construction is presented.  It is inspired by real-world
chemistry and has been compiled in close collaboration with medicinal
chemists to achieve high practical relevance.  Virtual molecules
assembled from existing starting material connected by these reactions
are supposed to have an enhanced chance to be amenable to real
chemical synthesis.  About 50% of the reactions in the dataset are
ring-forming reactions, which fosters the assembly of novel ring
systems and innovative chemotypes.  A comparison with a recent survey
of the reactions used in early drug discovery revealed considerable
overlaps with the collection presented here.  The dataset is available
encoded as computer-readable Reaction SMARTS expressions from the
Supporting Information presented for this paper.

The reactions are translated to LillyMol textproto format.

Unfortunately what we find is that there is almost full overlap between
this set of molecular transformations and what is available in
[Medchem Wizard](/data/MedchemWizard). Invoke with

There may be little reason to use these, but they are included for
completeness.
