This directory contains a set of ring replacements extracted from a recent version
of Chembl.

The files are named according to the whether you are running on a Mac or Linux
system. The reason for this is tha the Mac has a case insensitive file system.

The Linux naming has files named according to the kind of ring or ring system. For example
'rings.5a.smi' contains a list of five membered aromatic rings. On the other
hand the file `rings.5A.smi` contains a list of five membered aliphatic rings
extracted from Chembl. This naming convention follows the aromatic/aliphatic
conventions used in smarts.

But if running on a Mac, this is not possible, since these two files cannot
coexist.

The distribution comes with files named to accomodate a Mac, so files
like `rings.5Ar.smi` and 'rings.5Al.smi` are used.  The script
`to_linux.sh` converts the files to the Linux form.

The files in this directory were generated by
```
ring_extraction -A 2 -S rings -X Ar:Al -k -c -l -g all -v chembl.oksize.smi
```
using version 36 of Chembl.

Note that while the files have a .smi suffix, they are actually textproto files.
These can be processed with most LillyMol tools by specifying
```
-i textproto
```

although ring_replacement itself supports options (-D and -F) for subsetting
the replacement rings used.

A subsequent release may change the suffix of these files.
