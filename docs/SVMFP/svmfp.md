# SVM Fingerprint Models

LillyMol tool gfp_make can be used to generate an unlimited number of fingerprints.
Kernel based learners use similarity between training set members as the basis for learning.
The obvious step is to use the fingerprints generated by gfp_make as a kernel function in
an svm learner.

For this work we use [svm lite](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light). Note that
svm-lite does have specific licence requirements; please pay attention to that and make
sure that you are in compliance.

Theoretically other svm learners could have been used - when this was developed we
worked with both svm-lite and libsvm, but we first achieved good results with svm-lite.
Some have largely replicated this work by writing custom kernel functions to the svm learner in
scikit-learn, but at the expense of very slow model building.

## HowTo
Building an svmfp model requires two files

. train.smi
. train.activity

Both must be tabular, space separated files.

The smiles file might look like
```
C methane
CC etheane
```
and the activity file might look like
```
Id Activity
methane 1.234
ethane 0.922
```
For each identifier in the smiles file there must be an identifier and activity
entry in the `train.activity` file. Line ordering is not important.

## HowTo
Building a model, with the default fingerprints can be done via
```
svmfp_make.sh -mdir /path/to/model -A train.activity train.smi
```
where /path/to/model is a directory that will be created by the model
building. Safest would be to always build a new model directory.

Once the model is built, it can be used for scoring via
```
svmfp_evaluate.sh -mdir /path/to/model test.smi > test.pred
```
And the response in `test.pred` should be the same as what
was in `train.activity`.
