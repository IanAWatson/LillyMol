# LillyMol Python API Reference

This document is the API reference for the public LillyMol Python modules. For an
orientation to the Python interface, performance model, and common workflows, see
[README.md](README.md). For build and packaging instructions, see
[Build.md](Build.md).

The current Python bindings are built with nanobind. Earlier LillyMol Python
bindings used CLIF internally and then pybind11; those are historical details for
most users. The primary public module is `lillymol`. Compatibility modules such
as `lillymol_io`, `lillymol_tools`, and `lillymol_tsubstructure` re-export from
`lillymol` for older split-module imports.

## Philosophy
LillyMol has no concept of changeable and unchangeable molecules. Any molecule
can be altered at any time. This simplifies interaction with Molecules. In the
python implementation it does raise some risks of errors, while making certain operations
easier. Read on...

This works because the LillyMol Molecule is a very lazy object. It never computes
things like fragment membership, ring membership, aromaticity or canonical
ordering unless requested. So if you remove an atom, or bond, it will destroy any
information it has about those derived quantities. Only if requested will any
be recomputed.

This has many advantages. For example if a molecule is built from a smiles
and then the only thing ever requested is the number of atoms, that will be
very cheap. If the number of fragments is requested, then only fragment membership
is computed. Even if the most expensive derived property, the canonical order,
is requested, the actual unique smiles will not be generated unless requested.

While this generally works well, there is one caveat. Because of this, things
like Rings and Bonds, by default, do not know if they are aromatic or not, or
if they are in a ring or not. Since neither one knows anything about being in
a Molecule, the following does *not* do what it looks like
```
benzene.build_from_smiles('c1ccccc1')
benzene.ring(0).is_aromatic()    # False. Aromaticity has not been perceived.
```
Note that it does not raise - it returns a plausible wrong answer, quietly.
After anything that perceives aromaticity, it is right
```
if benzene.is_aromatic(0):       # Asking the Molecule perceives aromaticity
  ....
benzene.ring(0).is_aromatic()    # True
```
See [The lazy Molecule](README.md#the-lazy-molecule) for which call forces what.
In this case `benzene.is_aromatic(0)` meant that the Molecule needed to 
compute fragment membership, ring membership and aromaticity. Then
when the first ring, `ring(0)` was queried, it now knew that it was
aromatic.

Again, this is only an issue if you will be querying molecular properties
via Atoms, Bonds or Rings. If you get this information by asking the
Molecule, this happens automatically. If you are going to query individual
objects for things like aromaticity and ring membership start with
```
mol.compute_aromaticity_if_needed()
```
which will ensure that aromaticity information is propagated throughout
all parts of the molecule - and if that has already been done, this does
nothing.

Atoms do not know if they are in a ring or not, nor whether 
they are aromatic, or what fragment they are in. Fragment membership, 
ring  membership and aromaticity are molecular properties.
Same with chirality. Bonds are slightly different, in that Bonds do
know their ring membership, and if they are aromatic or not. But again
these quantities are not computed by default.

## Using LillyMol Python
The Molecule functionality must be imported
```
from lillymol import *
```
For those familiar with RDKit, this enables
```
m = MolFromSmiles('c1ccccc1')
```
and if an invalid smiles is encountered, None will be returned. There
is also a list form of this
```
mols = MolFromSmiles(["C", "CC", "C1CC1"])
```
which returns a list of molecules. This may offer speed advantages
depending on the structure of the program.

And for clarity
```
mol = LillyMolFromSmiles("C methane")
```
also works.


There are other means by which molecules can enter the system.

```
m = Molecule()
```
instantiates an empty molecule. That can then be constructed via something like
```
m.build_from_smiles('c1ccccc1')
```
which returns True if successful. The same Molecule can be re-used any number of
times with the `build_from_smiles` method, which first cleans out all atoms before
starting. See discussion of the addition operators later.

Molecules can also be read from files, which will likely be the most common case.

```
from lillymol_io import *

reader = Reader()
if not reader.open('/path/to/file.smi', FileType.SMI):
  logging.error('Cannot open...')

for m in reader:
  print(m)
```
This will print the smiles and name of each molecule. If reading a 
.sdf file, use `FileType.SDF`. LillyMol has a wide variety of directives
for reading .sdf files, many of which are now available via python.

Note that there will never be a None molecule returned. If a connection
table error is encountered, reading will cease. The Reader class has
a `set_ignore_connection_table_errors` method, which allows you
to set the number of otherwise fatal errors that are ignored. Warnings
will flash by on stderr, but nothing will show up in python. 

LillyMol has always operated on the principle that your input should
be correct. That said, it would not be hard to add an option to return
a None molecule in the event of an otherwise ignored error.

Note that in LillyMol a molecule with an invalid valence is a valid molecule.
If you don't want molecules with valence errors, use the valence_ok() method
to check each molecule and skip those having an invalid valence.

A more pythonic way of reading structures is available as
```
  with MolReaderContext('/path/to/file.sdf') as reader:
    for mol in reader:
      for atom in mol:
        ...
```
`MolReaderContext` is itself the iterator returned by the context manager. It also
has a `next()` method that returns a molecule or `None`, plus methods such as
`molecules_read()` and `set_ignore_connection_table_errors()`.

Common preprocessing can be applied while molecules are read. This uses the same
`MoleculePreprocessing` object used by LillyMol command line tools.
```
from lillymol_io import MolReaderContext

with MolReaderContext('/path/to/file.smi', largest_fragment=True,
                   remove_chirality=True, remove_isotopes=True) as reader:
  for mol in reader:
    ...
```
The preprocessing keyword options are `largest_fragment`, `remove_chirality`,
`remove_cis_trans_bonds`, and `remove_isotopes`. They default to `False`, so a
plain `MolReaderContext(fname)` preserves the input molecule as before.

SDF naming can also be controlled from `MolReaderContext`. By default LillyMol uses
the first SDF header line as the molecule name. To use a specific SD data tag as
the identifier:
```
with MolReaderContext('/path/to/file.sdf', sdf_identifier='CHEMBL_ID') as reader:
  for mol in reader:
    print(mol.name())
```
By default this produces names like `CHEMBL_ID:CHEMBL123`; use
`prepend_sdfid=False` if only the tag value should become the molecule name.

To retain SD tag data in the molecule name, ask for JSON form. With
`all_sdf_tags=True`, every SD tag is included in the JSON object.
```
with MolReaderContext('/path/to/file.sdf', sdf_tags_to_json=True,
                   all_sdf_tags=True) as reader:
  for mol in reader:
    print(mol.name())
```
There is also a `first_sdf_tag=True` option for using the first SD data item as
the molecule name.

If you want SD tag data as structured Python data, keep the SDF tags while
reading and call `sdf_tags()` on the molecule. Multi-line SD values are returned
as one string with embedded newline characters.
```
with MolReaderContext('/path/to/file.sdf', keep_sdf_tags=True) as reader:
  for mol in reader:
    tags = mol.sdf_tags()
    print(tags.get('CHEMBL_ID'))
```
Without `keep_sdf_tags=True`, `mol.sdf_tags()` returns an empty dictionary.

When the same read settings are reused, collect them in a `ReaderOptions` object.
This is often clearer than passing several keyword arguments repeatedly.
```
from lillymol_io import MolReaderContext, ReaderOptions

options = ReaderOptions(largest_fragment=True,
                        sdf_identifier='CHEMBL_ID',
                        prepend_sdfid=False)

with MolReaderContext('/path/to/first.sdf', options=options) as reader:
  for mol in reader:
    ...

with MolReaderContext('/path/to/second.sdf', options=options) as reader:
  for mol in reader:
    ...
```
`ReaderOptions` has the same fields as the keyword arguments: `largest_fragment`,
`remove_chirality`, `remove_cis_trans_bonds`, `remove_isotopes`,
`keep_sdf_tags`, `sdf_identifier`, `sdf_tags_to_json`, `all_sdf_tags`,
`first_sdf_tag`, and `prepend_sdfid`. The fields are mutable, and an existing
`MolReaderContext` can be updated with `reader.apply_options(options)`.

`MolReaderContext` stores these SDF naming options on the reader, so separate
`MolReaderContext` objects can use different SDF identifiers at the same time. The
older module-level SDF functions still change the global MDL/SDF defaults used
by raw `Reader` objects and by newly created reader-local options.

`ReaderContext` remains available as a compatibility alias for `MolReaderContext`.
`ContextWriter` remains available as a compatibility alias for `MolWriterContext`.

`MoleculePreprocessing` can also be used directly when you want explicit control.
`process()` changes the molecule supplied, while `process_copy()` leaves the
original molecule unchanged.
```
from lillymol import MolFromSmiles
from lillymol_io import MoleculePreprocessing

mol = MolFromSmiles('C.CC example')
prep = MoleculePreprocessing(largest_fragment=True)
fragment = prep.process_copy(mol)
```

The loop above also shows that a molecule is iterable, and a stream
of Atom objects is returned. In LillyMol, Atoms know nothing about
a Molecule, so if you want the atom number something like
```
for atom_number, atom in enumerate(mol):
  print(f'atom {atom_number} atomic number {atom.atomic_number()}')
```
the atoms are iterated in sequential order, so enumerate works.

While an Atom does not know anything about being part of a Molecule,
the Molecule can query each of its atoms for properties associated
with each atom. Therefore
```
m.atomic_number(3)
m[3].atomic_number()
```
both report the atomic number of atom 3. The first queried the
molecule, and the second retrieved the third atom and asked it
for the atomic number. In terms of efficiency, the first method
will be more efficient in python.

And for the greatest simplicity in getting a list of molecules
into python
```
mols = slurp(fname)
```
will read all molecules from `fname` into a list. Note that this
only works if `fname` has the proper suffix, and it will not work
if trying to read stdin. Returns None if anything goes wrong. Note
that if any molecule fails nothing is returned.

## Chirality

LillyMol stores chiral centres on the `Molecule`, not on `Atom` objects.
An `Atom` only becomes a chiral centre because of its relationship to 
other atoms in a `Molecule`.
`chiral_centre_at_atom(atom)` returns the stored `Chiral_Centre` for an atom,
if one is present. A stored chiral centre records molecular annotation; it does
not by itself prove that the atom is actually stereogenic.

A LillyMol ChiralCentre object has a central atom, and other atoms called
`top_front`, `top_back`, `left_down` and `right_down`.
```
m = MolFromSmiles("F[C@H](N)O")
m.number_chiral_centres()
1
c = m.chiral_centre_at_atom(1)
<Chiral_Centre atom 1 tf 0 tb H ld 2 rd 3>
```
These attachments can be accessed with `c.top_front()`, `c.top_back()`,
`c.left_down()` and `c.right_down()`. `c.atoms()` returns the same four values as
`[top_front, top_back, left_down, right_down]`, and `Chiral_Centre` objects can
be iterated in that same order. Each value is an atom number for an explicit
atom. For non-atom attachments it returns one of the module constants
`CHIRAL_CONNECTION_IS_IMPLICIT_HYDROGEN` or
`CHIRAL_CONNECTION_IS_LONE_PAIR`. The helper predicates
`is_chiral_implicit_hydrogen(value)` and `is_chiral_lone_pair(value)` are also
available when code wants to avoid comparing sentinel values directly.

`chiral_centre_at_atom(atom)` and `chiral_centres()` return copies of the stored
`Chiral_Centre` objects. This avoids lifetime problems if the parent `Molecule`
is a temporary. In Python, `Chiral_Centre` is intended as an inspection object;
operations that change chirality are exposed on `Molecule`, such as
`invert_chirality_on_atom(atom)`, `remove_chiral_centre_at_atom(atom)`, and
`remove_all_chiral_centres()`.

```python
from lillymol import MolFromSmiles, CHIRAL_CONNECTION_IS_IMPLICIT_HYDROGEN

c = MolFromSmiles("F[C@H](Cl)Br").chiral_centre_at_atom(1)
print(c.top_back() == CHIRAL_CONNECTION_IS_IMPLICIT_HYDROGEN)
for position, atom in enumerate(c):
    print(position, atom)
```

`is_actually_chiral(mol, atom)` performs the more expensive check for whether an
atom is actually chiral.

`tetrahedral_chirality(mol, atom, check_is_chiral=False)` returns a `ChiralType`
value for a stored tetrahedral centre, or `None` if there is no chiral centre at
that atom. Values include `ChiralType.CHI_TETRAHEDRAL_CW`,
`ChiralType.CHI_TETRAHEDRAL_CCW`, `ChiralType.CHI_UNSPECIFIED`, and
`ChiralType.CHI_OTHER`.

The CW/CCW designator is LillyMol-defined. It is computed relative to ascending
explicit atom numbers, with an implicit Hydrogen ordered after all explicit
atoms. This makes the result deterministic and independent of input bond order;
it is not intended to reproduce RDKit's bond-order-dependent `ChiralTag`.

If `check_is_chiral=True`, `tetrahedral_chirality` first calls
`is_actually_chiral`, which may trigger a more expensive scan of the molecule.
This is useful for filtering stored chiral annotations that are not actually
stereogenic.

```python
from lillymol import MolFromSmiles, ChiralType, tetrahedral_chirality

mol = MolFromSmiles("C[C@H](N)F")
print(tetrahedral_chirality(mol, 1) == ChiralType.CHI_TETRAHEDRAL_CCW)

mol = MolFromSmiles("N[C@H]1CCC1")
print(tetrahedral_chirality(mol, 1) is not None)                     # stored
print(tetrahedral_chirality(mol, 1, check_is_chiral=True) is None)   # checked
```


## Atom Hybridization

`hybridization(atom)` returns a `Hybridization` enum value computed from the
current molecular graph. There is also a module-level `hybridization(mol, atom)`
function and `hybridization_name(value)` for converting enum values to strings
such as `SP2` and `SP3`.

This is a small RDKit-compatibility convenience for Python workflows, not a
substructure-search feature. The detailed behaviour and known limits are in
[Molecule_Lib/hybridisation.md](/docs/Molecule_Lib/hybridisation.md).

```python
from lillymol import MolFromSmiles, Hybridization, hybridization_name

mol = MolFromSmiles("CC(=O)N")
print(mol.hybridization(3) == Hybridization.SP2)
print(hybridization_name(mol.hybridization(3)))
```

## Through-Bond Paths

`bonds_between(a1, a2)` returns the topological distance between two atoms.
`atoms_on_shortest_path(a1, a2)` returns atoms on one shortest path between the
endpoints. If multiple shortest paths exist, the path chosen is arbitrary.

`all_atoms_between(a1, a2)` returns all intermediate atoms that lie on shortest
paths between the endpoints. The atoms are returned in breadth-first order from
`a1`. Both path methods omit the endpoint atoms and return `None` when there are
no intermediate atoms.

`renumber_atoms(new_number)` changes atom numbering in place. The list must be a
permutation of `range(mol.natoms())`; `new_number[i]` is the new atom number for
the atom currently numbered `i`. Invalid length, duplicate atom numbers, or atom
numbers outside `[0, natoms)` raise `ValueError`.

```python
mol = MolFromSmiles("CNO")
mol.renumber_atoms([2, 0, 1])
print([mol.atomic_number(i) for i in range(mol.natoms())])  # [7, 8, 6]
```

```python
from lillymol import MolFromSmiles

mol = MolFromSmiles("C1CCC1")

# 0 and 2 are opposite atoms in cyclobutane. There are two shortest paths.
print(list(mol.atoms_on_shortest_path(0, 2)))  # one of [1] or [3]
print(sorted(mol.all_atoms_between(0, 2)))     # [1, 3]

# Opposite atoms in cyclohexane. Breadth-first order from atom 0.
print(list(mol.all_atoms_between(0, 3)))       # [1, 5, 2, 4]
```

## Atom Methods
As mentioned previously, LillyMol Atoms are fairly simple, and have no idea
that they are part of a Molecule. The only attributes an atom has is

* Pointer to an Element
* Isotope
* Coordinates
* Implicit Hydrogen info
* Formal Charge
* Number of bonds
* List of Bonds involving the Atom.
* Atom Map number

and some more obscure things.

The Atom object supports
| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| atomic_number() | Atomic number |
| atomic_weight() | Atomic weight |
| exact_mass() | exact_mass |
| ncon() | Number of connections/edges |
| nbonds() | Number of bonds, single=1, double=2, triple=3 |
| formal_charge() | Formal charge |
| other(atom_number, ndx) | atom number of the 'ndx' connection |
| is_bonded_to(atom) | True if atom is bonded to 'atom' |
| valence_ok(atom) | True if valence ok |
| fully_saturated() | True if nbonds() == ncon() |
| connections() | iterable list of atoms attached |
| implicit_hydrogens | number of implicit hydrogens attached |
| \__iter__ | List of Bonds attached |
| \__contains__ | True if atom is bonded to |
| \__len__ | Number of connections |

It is important to note that `ncon()` returns the number of explicit atoms in
connected to an atom. Implicit Hydrogen atoms are not counted.

In addition an Atom object inherits from an object that holds coordinates. Subsequent
versions will enable more of that functionality. For now the subtraction operator
returns the distance between two atoms, although long term this must be changed
so that subtraction of two atoms returns the vector between them.
```
m.build_from_smiles("C{{0,0,0}}C{{1,1,1}}"))
m[0] - m[1]
```
reports sqrt(3). For now... Use `m.distance_between_atoms(atom1, atom2)` to
reliably obtain the geometric distance between two atoms in a molecule.
The same result will be obtained by the atom based method `m[atom1].distance(m[atom2])`.
That latter invocation would be very inefficient, since two `Atom` objects
would need to be instantiated in Python, whereas the `Molecule` based
method avoids that conversion entirely.

A common construct might be (count the number of carbon=,#nitrogen bonds)
```
  result = 0
  for i, atom in enumerate(m):
    if atom.atomic_number() != 7:
      continue
    for bond in atom:
      if bond.is_single_bond():
        continue
      other = bond.other(i)
      if m.atomic_number(other) == 6:
        result += 1
```
But as is often the case, there is a more efficient way of doing this. The
above will visit each Bond twice - since each atom knows about all Bonds.
Traversing the bond list results in each Bond being examined only once.
```
  result = 0
  for bond in m.bonds():
    if bond.is_single_bond():
      continue
    a1 = bond.a1()
    a2 = bond.a2()
    if m.atomic_number(a1) == 6 and m.atomic_number(a2) == 7:
      result += 1
    elif m.atomic_number(a1) == 7 and m.atomic_number(a2) == 6:
      result += 1
```
Knowing when to solve a problem by traversing atoms and when to traverse
bonds can be hard.

## Bond Methods
Again, the Bond class really does not know much.

* The two atoms that define the bond.
* The bond type
* Ring membership
* Directional or not

And a couple of other things.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| a1() | The first  atom |
| a2() | The second atom |
| btype() | The bond type |
| other(atom_number) | The atom that is not 'atom_number' |
| involves(atom_number) | True if 'atom_number' is a1 or a2 |
| is_single_bond() | True if the bond is a single bond |
| is_double_bond() | True if the bond is a double bond |
| is_triple_bond() | True if the bond is a triple bond |
| is_aromatic() | True if the bond is aromatic |
| nrings() | The number of rings involving this bond |
| IsInRing() | True if bond is in a ring |
| is_directional(() | True if bond is directional |
| GetBeginAtomIdx() | Same as a1() |
| GetEndAtomIdx() | Same as a2() |
| GetBondType() | Same as btype() |
| \__contains__ | involves() |

## Set_of_Atoms Methods
Set_of_Atoms objects are used extensively in LillyMol. Despite the name,
they are actually just vectors of atom numbers, with no requirement for
uniqueness. That said, it would be a very unusual application where a
Set_of_Atoms contained duplicate atom numbers.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| empty() | True of the set is empty |
| size() | Number of items |
| set_vector(list, value) | Set list[i] to `value` for each atom i in the set |
| scatter(list, value) | Alias for `set_vector(list, value)` |
| increment_vector(list, value) | Increment list[i] by `value` for each atom i in the set |
| \__len__ | Number of items |
| \__getitem__ | Access via [i] |
| \__iter__ | Access atoms via iterators |
| \__contains__ | Is atom included |

`set_vector`, `scatter`, and `increment_vector` mutate normal Python lists.
They are useful for turning an embedding into per-atom flags without constructing
an intermediate molecule-sized array in Python.

## Ring Methods
A Molecule may have rings. Ring's are just Set_of_Atoms's that have some
extra information.

* Aromaticity
* Fused Ring neighbours.

In addition, the atoms in the Ring are ordered, so if they are iterated, they will
trace out a bonded path through the ring.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| size() | size |
| ring_number() | unique ring number |
| fragment_membership() | fragment number containing ring |
| fused_system_identifier() | fused system number containing this ring |
| is_fused() | True if ring is fused to another ring |
| fused_ring_neighbours() | Number of fused neighbours |
| is_fused_to(ring) | True if fused to another ring number |
| largest_number_of_bonds_shared_with_another_ring() | for flat ring systems, this will be 1 |
| strongly_fused_ring_neighbours() | Rings sharing more than 1 bond |
| contains_bond(a1, a2) | True if Ring contains these adjacent atoms |
| is_aromatic() | True if ring is aromatic |
| \__contains__ | Is atom included |
| \__len__ | Size |

To count the number of isolated (not fused) 5 membered aromatic rings
```
  result = 0
  m.compute_aromaticity_if_needed()

  for ring in m.rings():
    if len(ring) != 5:
      continue
    if ring.is_fused():
      continue;
    if ring.is_aromatic():
      result += 1
```

Counting the number of pyrrole type nitrogens, in isolated rings.
```
  result = 0
  for ring in m.rings():
    if len(ring) != 5:
      continue
    if ring.is_fused():
      continue;
    if not ring.is_aromatic():
      continue
    for atom in ring:
      if m.atomic_number(atom) == 7 && m.hcount(atom) == 1:
        result += 1
```
However it is unclear whether this would be more/or less efficient than the 
equivalent.

```
  result = 0
  for i, atom in enumerate(m):
    if atom.atomic_number() != 7:
      continue
    if not m.is_aromatic(i):
      continue
    if atom.hcount() == 0:
      continue
    if not m.in_ring_of_given_size(i, 5):
      continue
    if m.fused_system_size(i) == 1:
      result += 1
```

## Chemical Standardisation
Any work with molecules should ensure that molecules are represented in a consistent
manner. For example, are all the acids in charged or neutral forms? How are the nitro
groups represented? Etc...

Trying to formulate substructure queries that can accommodate these variations is
challenging, and inefficient. LillyMol has a module that enforces consistent
molecular representations.

```
from lillymol_std import *
standardise = Chemical_Standardisation()
standardise.activate_all()
for mol in reader:
  standardise.process(m)
  # m is now in a consistent form for subsequent processing.
```

You may, or may not like how the molecules are changed, but they are all changed to
be consistent.

Within the C++ there are options for turning on just specific transformations, and
for transforming certain forms from LillyMol standard forms back to other forms;
transforming `N(=O)=O` to `[N+](=O)-[O-]` for example.

## Substructure Searching
LillyMol supports a rich set of substructure query capabilities. All involve a
`Substructure_Query` object that can be instantiate from

* smarts
* Molecule
* textproto file
* MDL query file

The current python implementation focuses on smarts and textproto forms.

Enable substructure searching via
```
from lillymol_query import *
```
Instantiate a new query for a para substituted methoxy group via the
one-line helper
```
query = QueryFromSmarts('[CH3]-[OD2]-c:c:c:[cD3]')
if query is None:
  logging.error('Invalid smarts')
```

This will generally be the most convenient way to build a query from SMARTS.
It returns a `SubstructureQuery` object on success and `None` if the SMARTS
cannot be parsed.

The equivalent two-step form is also available, which can be useful if you want
to allocate the object first and configure it explicitly
```
query = SubstructureQuery()
if not query.build_from_smarts('[CH3]-[OD2]-c:c:c:[cD3]'):
  logging.error('Invalid smarts')
```

To read a query from a textproto query specification
```
query = SubstructureQuery()
if not query.read_proto('/path/to/file.textproto'):
  logging.error('Cannot read query file %s...')
```

To perform a substructure search, not recording anything about the
atoms matched
```
m = MolFromSmiles('C(=N)(C1=C(O)C(=C(O)C=C1O)OC)CC1=CC=C(O)C=C1 CHEMBL503634')
query.substructure_search(m)
```
The number of matches will be returned. In this case it will frequently be 2 since
the query will match two times in a benzene like ring.

For a simple boolean test, use Python's `in` operator with the query on the
left and the molecule on the right
```
if query in m:
  print('matched')
```
This is equivalent to asking whether `query.substructure_search(m)` finds at
least one match, but it does not return the match count or matched atoms.

To get the matched atoms directly as a list of `Set_of_Atoms` objects, use:
```python
matches = query.substructure_search_matches(m)
```

For example if you wanted to place an isotope on each set of matched atoms that might look like
```
for match in query.substructure_search_matches(m):
  m.remove_isotopes()
  m.set_isotopes(match, 1)
  print(m)
```
Omit the `remove_isotopes` call to overwrite the new isotopes onto whatever isotopes might have already been there.

On the other hand if you need to know which matched atom is which, that might look like
```
for match in query.substructure_search_matches(m):
  m.remove_isotopes()
  for ndx, atom in enumerate(match):
    m.set_isotope(atom, ndx + 1)
  print(m)
```
Note that the isotope placed is incremented by 1 since isotope 0 does not mean anything.

For one-off SMARTS searches there are convenience functions whose names are
close to the common RDKit spelling. These build a temporary query, apply any
keyword options, search the molecule, and discard the query.

```python
m = MolFromSmiles("CCOC ethoxyethane")

if HasSubstructMatch(m, "[OD2]-C"):
  print("ether oxygen")

print(CountSubstructMatches(m, "C", max_matches_to_find=2))

for embedding in GetSubstructMatches(m, "[OD2]-C",
                                     unique_embeddings_only=True):
  print(embedding)
```

`GetSubstructMatches` returns a Python list of embeddings, where each embedding
is a list of atom numbers. The atom numbers within each embedding follow the atom
order in the query.

The keyword options accepted by these transient SMARTS helpers are
`max_matches_to_find`, `unique_embeddings_only`, `one_embedding_per_start_atom`,
and `perceive_symmetry_equivalent_matches`. Reusable `SubstructureQuery` objects
do not accept per-call overrides; their match policy remains a property of the
query and is controlled by the setter methods below.

The Substructure_Query class has a wide variety of options that control the matching. Those
are described in the `trxn` usage document. Here they are just listed

* set_only_keep_matches_in_largest_fragment
* set_embeddings_do_not_overlap
* set_find_one_embedding_per_atom
* set_find_unique_embeddings_only
* set_max_matches_to_find
* set_perceive_symmetry_equivalent_matches
* set_min_atoms_to_match
* set_max_atoms_to_match
* max_query_atoms_matched_in_search

### Examining atoms around a substructure match

A substructure search can populate an explicit `SubstructureResults` object. It
contains one or more embeddings, each represented by a `Set_of_Atoms` containing
the molecule atom numbers matched by the query. These embeddings can be passed
directly to `atoms_by_radius`:

```python
m = MolFromSmiles("CCOC")
query = QueryFromSmarts("[OD2]")
sresults = SubstructureResults()

if query.substructure_search(m, sresults):
  for matched_atoms in sresults:
    shells = m.atoms_by_radius(matched_atoms, 2)
    print("matched", list(shells[0]))
    print("one bond away", list(shells[1]))
    print("two bonds away", list(shells[2]))
```

`atoms_by_radius` performs one graph traversal and returns a list indexed by exact
minimum bond distance. Element zero is the starting set, element one contains
atoms one bond away, and so on. Each atom occurs in only one shell, even when it
is reachable from several matched atoms. Empty outer shells are retained. This
operation can therefore be embedded in a larger loop over molecules and query
embeddings without recomputing the inner shells for each radius.

## GFP fingerprint files and similarity search

`GFPList` provides read/search access to LillyMol GFP fingerprints. It can read
precomputed `.gfp`/TDT fingerprint files, and it can also generate the standard
LillyMol GFP fingerprint directly from Python `Molecule` objects. For a shorter
orientation, see the [GFP quickstart](fingerprints.md#gfp-quickstart).

### Reading an existing GFP file

```python
from lillymol import GFPList

gfp = GFPList.from_file("collection.gfp")

print(len(gfp))
print(gfp.tags())
print(gfp.smiles(0), gfp.id(0))

print(gfp.distance(0, 1))
```

The fingerprint schema is discovered from the tags in the first TDT in the file.
All subsequent fingerprints are interpreted with that same schema. Tag order in
the TDT is not significant, but all fingerprints in a `GFPList` must contain the
same components. Common tags include `MPR<` for molecular properties, `FP...<`
for fixed binary fingerprints, `NC...<` for sparse non-colliding fingerprints,
and `FC...<` for fixed counted fingerprints.

### Generating standard GFP fingerprints

The standard LillyMol GFP fingerprint can be generated directly from molecules.
This currently creates the long-standing standard GFP components:

- `FPIW<` path fingerprint
- `FPMK<` MACCS keys
- `FPMK2<` level-2 MACCS keys
- `MPR<` molecular properties

Use a `GFPContext` when you want standalone query fingerprints:

```python
from lillymol import Molecule
from lillymol import GFPContext

ctx = GFPContext.standard()

mol = Molecule()
mol.build_from_smiles("CCO ethanol")
fp = ctx.fingerprint(mol)

print(ctx.distance(fp, fp))
```

The same standard context can also be built explicitly from immutable generator
specifications. This is the extension point for adding more fingerprint
generators while keeping the context schema explicit.

```python
from lillymol import GFP, GFPContext

ctx = GFPContext.from_specs([
    GFP.iw(),
    GFP.maccs(level2=True),
    GFP.mpr(),
])
```

The component tags are generated by C++ from the full specification. Duplicate
tags are rejected, because a `GFPContext` cannot contain two indistinguishable
fingerprint components. The order of the specs is not significant; components
are canonicalized before the context hash is computed.

`GFP.maccs(level2=False)` generates only `FPMK<`; the default generates both
`FPMK<` and `FPMK2<`.

`GFP.alogp(replicates=9)` adds a sparse counted alogp component. The tag
contains the replicate count, for example `NCALOGP9<`, so contexts built with
different replicate counts are not compatible. The replicated bits all carry the
same bucketized alogp value as their count, matching the command-line alogp
fingerprint convention.

`GFP.xlogp(replicates=9)` adds the analogous sparse counted xlogp component
with tags such as `NCXLOGP9<`. It uses the xlogp command-line fingerprint
bucketization convention.

`GFP.tpsa(replicates=9)` adds a sparse counted topological polar surface area
component with tags such as `NCTPSA9<`. It preserves the command-line `psafp`
convention: TPSA is divided by 10, rounded to an integer bucket, and stored as
the count on each replicated bit, with a minimum count of 1.

`GFP.formula()` adds a fixed-size counted molecular formula fingerprint with
tag `FCFML<`. It uses the formula fingerprint log scaling defaults
recommended by the command-line tool, preserving the nonlinear count
scaling that emphasizes low element-count differences and compresses
differences among more abundant elements. The change going from one Oxygen
atom to two Oxygen atoms is much more important than going from 15 to 16
Carbon atoms.

`GFP.cats(max_path_length=10, include_hydrophobic_pairs=True)` adds the sparse
counted CATS pharmacophore-pair fingerprint. The tag is `NCCATS10<` when
hydrophobic-hydrophobic pairs are included and `NCCATSP10<` when they are
suppressed. The `P` suffix preserves the long-standing command-line convention
where the `jwcats -p` option suppresses hydrophobic-hydrophobic pairs. CATS
initialization requires `LILLYMOL_HOME` so the default charge and
donor/acceptor assigners can be loaded.

`GFP.atom_pair(min_separation=1, max_separation=10, atom_type="UST:Y",
include_out_of_range=False)` adds the newer sparse counted atom-pair
fingerprint. The default atom type matches the command-line tool. Setting
`min_separation=0` includes the single-atom atom-type bits. When
`include_out_of_range=True`, atom pairs beyond `max_separation` are collected in
the truncated out-of-range bucket, matching the command-line `-t` behavior.

`GFP.ec(radius=3, atom_type="UST:Z")` adds a sparse counted extended
connectivity fingerprint. The default atom type is atomic number (`UST:Z`). The
radius and atom-type specification are encoded in the tag, for example
`NCEC3USTZ<` or `NCEC3USTAY<`. Colons in atom-type specifications are omitted
from tags; other non-alphanumeric characters are rejected. Multiple EC
fingerprints with different atom types can be combined in one context.

`GFP.substructure(smarts, radius=0, atom_type="UST:ARY", no_match="empty")`
adds a fixed-width binary path fingerprint over the atoms matched by one SMARTS
query, optionally expanded by `radius` bonds around all matched atoms. The tag
starts with `FPSUB` and includes the radius, atom type, and a stable hash of the
query specification. When `no_match="empty"`, molecules that do not match the
query receive an empty fingerprint component. When `no_match="error"`,
fingerprint generation fails for non-matching molecules.

```python
ctx = GFPContext.from_specs([
    GFP.substructure("n1cncc1", radius=4),
])
```

`GFP.ring_substitution()` adds the ring-substitution fingerprint with tag
`NCRS<`. It uses the defaults used by `gfp_make.pl`: full substituent atom
typing and single-feature bits.

`GFP.spinach(label_join_points=False)` adds a fixed-width binary path
fingerprint over the molecular spinach, the atoms outside the scaffold. The tag
is `FPSPIN<`. When `label_join_points=True`, atoms at the scaffold/spinach join
are isotope-labelled before atom typing and the tag is `FPSPINI<`.

`GFP.scaffold(label_join_points=False)` adds the corresponding fixed-width
binary path fingerprint over the scaffold atoms. The tag is `FPSCAF<`, or
`FPSCAFI<` when join points are labelled. Both scaffold and spinach
fingerprints use the same `IdentifySpinachLabel` perception and the
`IWMFingerprint` atom include mask, so they can be combined in one context
without changing the input molecule.

For example:

```python
from lillymol import GFP, GFPContext

ctx = GFPContext.from_specs([
    GFP.spinach(label_join_points=True),
    GFP.scaffold(label_join_points=True),
])
```

Use `GFPList.standard()` when you want to build a searchable collection from
Python molecules:

```python
from lillymol import Molecule
from lillymol import GFPContext, GFPList

gfp = GFPList.standard()

for smiles in ["CC ethane", "CCC propane", "CCCC butane"]:
  mol = Molecule()
  mol.build_from_smiles(smiles)
  gfp.add(mol)

query = Molecule()
query.build_from_smiles("CCC query")
query_fp = GFPContext.standard().fingerprint(query)

hits = gfp.nearest_neighbours(query_fp, 3)
for hit in hits:
  print(hit.index, hit.distance, gfp.id(hit.index))
```

If the molecules are already available as a Python list, build the list in one
call. By default this does not store smiles/id metadata because the caller
already owns the molecules and can keep whatever metadata structure is most
convenient. Set `store_metadata=True` if the `GFPList` should retain smiles and
ids for later `smiles(index)` and `id(index)` calls.

```python
from lillymol import GFPContext, GFPList, MolFromSmiles

molecules = MolFromSmiles([
    "CC ethane",
    "CCC propane",
    "CCCC butane",
])

gfp = GFPList.standard_from_molecules(molecules, store_metadata=True)

# Later additions can also be batched. This defaults to not storing smiles/id
# metadata unless store_metadata=True is supplied.
gfp.add_molecules(more_molecules, store_metadata=True)
```

When an explicit context is useful, construct the list from that context and add
molecules in one batch:

```python
ctx = GFPContext.standard()
gfp = GFPList(ctx)
gfp.add_molecules(molecules, store_metadata=True)
```

If the input is a list of SMILES strings from another toolkit and no identifiers
are needed, use `add_smiles()`:

```python
gfp = GFPList.standard()
gfp.add_smiles(["CC", "CCC", "CCCC"])
```

`add_smiles()` never stores smiles/id metadata. Use `MolFromSmiles()` plus
`add_molecules(..., store_metadata=True)` when ids should be retained.

A `GFPList` either stores metadata for every entry or for none. Mixing the two
modes is rejected. Lists read from `.gfp` files and lists built with
`GFPList.add(mol)` store metadata. Batch construction defaults to no metadata.

Batch construction and `add_molecules()` pass pointers to the existing Python
`Molecule` objects into C++ rather than copying the molecules into a temporary
`std::vector<Molecule>`. This matters for large collections. Fingerprint
generation follows the standard GFP preprocessing used by the existing C++ GFP
server path, and may update normal LillyMol cached/perceived state on the input
molecule. It should not make destructive structural changes. If molecules have
already been standardised and preprocessed, this step can be skipped:

```python
ctx = GFPContext.standard(preprocess=False)
gfp = GFPList.standard(preprocess=False)
```

### Context compatibility

A `GFPFingerprint` is only meaningful with the `GFPContext` that generated it,
or with another context that has the same fingerprint schema. The Python binding
checks this compatibility before list/query distance calculations. Combining a
fingerprint generated by one context with a list using a different schema raises
`ValueError`.

This means a query fingerprint used against a `GFPList.standard()` collection
should be generated with `GFPContext.standard()` using the same settings. A
fingerprint generated with the standard context is not compatible with a list
read from a file that contains a different set of fingerprint tags.

### Nearest neighbours

Nearest-neighbour searches return `GFPNearestNeighbour` objects. The `index` is
the row number in the `GFPList`; use `smiles(index)` and `id(index)` to retrieve
the original molecule metadata.

```python
hits = gfp.nearest_neighbours(0, 10)
for hit in hits:
  print(hit.index, hit.distance, gfp.id(hit.index))

close = gfp.nearest_neighbours_within_distance(0, 0.25)
for hit in close:
  print(hit.index, hit.distance, gfp.smiles(hit.index), gfp.id(hit.index))
```

`nearest_neighbours(query, k)` returns up to `k` neighbours sorted by increasing
distance. `nearest_neighbours_within_distance(query, max_distance)` returns all
neighbours within the threshold, also sorted by increasing distance. When
`query` is a row number, the query fingerprint itself is not included in either
result. When `query` is a standalone `GFPFingerprint`, all list entries are
eligible neighbours.

### Component selection and weights

Fingerprint components can be selected and weighted by tag name.

```python
gfp.use_only(["FPIW<", "FPMK<"])
gfp.set_weight("FPMK<", 0.25)
gfp.use_all()
```

Weights affect subsequent distance and nearest-neighbour calculations. Changing
weights does not change the context compatibility hash, since the underlying
fingerprint schema is unchanged.

### Error handling

The Python API is designed to fail loudly in notebooks:

- unreadable GFP files raise `RuntimeError`
- trying to generate a fingerprint from a context that cannot generate
  fingerprints raises `RuntimeError`
- invalid row indices raise `IndexError`
- incompatible fingerprint contexts raise `ValueError`
- negative distance thresholds raise `ValueError`
- unknown component tags in `use_only` or `set_weight` raise `RuntimeError`

Repeated calls to `distance(i, j)` perform repeated distance computations. For
large all-against-all or repeated-nearest-neighbour workflows, prefer the
nearest-neighbour methods.

### Precomputed truncated distance matrices

`lillymol_tools.TruncatedDistanceMatrix` loads a TFDataRecord file of serialized
near-neighbour protos, normally produced by
`gfp_nearneighbours_single_file_tbb -S`, and provides repeated lookup of stored
pair-wise distances. Distances not present in the file are treated as omitted
long-range pairs: `distance(i, j)`
returns `None`, while `distance_or_default(i, j)` returns the matrix default
distance.

```python
from lillymol_tools import (
    TruncatedDistanceMatrix, TruncatedDistanceMatrixStorage,
    TruncatedDistanceMatrixProto,
)

dm = TruncatedDistanceMatrix(
    "file.nn.tfdata",
    storage=TruncatedDistanceMatrixStorage.ROW_SPARSE,
)

indexed_dm = TruncatedDistanceMatrix(
    "file.indexed.nn.tfdata",
    storage=TruncatedDistanceMatrixStorage.ROW_SPARSE,
    proto_type=TruncatedDistanceMatrixProto.NEARNEIGHBOURS_INDICES,
)

print(dm.index("CHEMBL123"))
print(dm.name(17))
print(dm.distance(10, 17))
print(dm.distance_or_default(10, 17))
```

Use `distances_or_default(i_values, j_values)` for batch lookup from Python.
See [Truncated Distance Matrix](/docs/GFP/truncated_distance_matrix.md) for the
file-generation requirements, storage modes, default-distance behaviour, and C++
API.

    logging.error('Cannot interpret smirks %s...
```
If the reaction is a simple form that has either no sidechains,
or all sidechains have a single, already specified, reagent, then
the `in_place_transformations` method can be used.
```
  rxn.in_place_transformations(m)
```
will perform a reaction to however many substructure matches
there are in `m`. This may, or may not be what you want. Since
a reaction inherits from a Substructure_Query object, there are
methods available for modifying the matching.

For more control over multiple matches, something like this may help
```
  rxn = Reaction()
  rxn.read('/path/to/reaction.textproto')
  matches = rxn.substructure_search_matches(m)
  # stop here if zero matches...
  for match in matches:
    product = rxn.perform_reaction(m, match)
    product.set_name(m.name() + ' ' + rxn.name())
    print(product)
```
or
```
  [product = rxn.perform_reaction(m, match) for match in matches]
```

### Multiple Reagents
The reaction object was designed to be able to rapidly enumerate large combinatorial
libraries. For this reason, it stores precomputed sets of sidechain reagents, which can
be rapidly added to a new scaffold. We cycle through these sidechains via an
iterator class. This workflow looks like 

1. Instantiate Reaction
2. Add reagents to the reaction
3. Process scaffolds, generating multiple products for each scaffold.

In python, for a reaction with a single sidechain, processing a set of
molecules might look like
```
  rxn = Reaction()
  rxn.read('/path/to/reaction.textproto')
  rxn.add_sidechain_reagents(0, '/path/to/r2.smi', FileType.SMI)

  matches = rxn.substructure_search_matches(mol)
  if not matches:
    logging.error("No matches to %s", mol.name())

  iter = ReactionIterator(rxn)

  for scaffold in reader:
    iter.reset()
    while iter.active():
      for match in matches:
        product = rxn.perform_reaction(mol, match, iter)
        # do something with product

      iter++
```
The loop involving 'iter.active()' will loop over the reagents stored
in the reaction. For each such reagent, a product will be formed for
each embedding of the query in 'm', generating `number_reagents * number_matches`
products. Some molecules may have differing numbers of matches...

## Formal Charge Assignment
LillyMol contains a set of formal charge rules primarily developed by Robert F Bruns
at Lilly during the 1990's. These rules have proven robust over the years, with strong
concordance with other rule sets, with seemingly better results in many cases. From
the command line the script assign_formal_charges.sh assigns formal charges to a file
of molecules.

In order to access this functionality from python, a ChargeAssigner object must
be instantiated.
```
chg = ChargeAssigner()
for mol in mols:
  chg.process(mol)
```
If needed, the return code from `chg.process` is the number of formal charges assigned
to the molecule.

## Donor Acceptor Assignment.
LillyMol contains a set of donor acceptor rules primarily developed by Robert F Bruns
at Lilly during the 1990's. Acknowledge that definitions of donors and acceptors is
very complex with instances of various weak forms being found in various circumstances.
The rules apply mostly to strong donors and acceptors. One possibly novel concept is
the idea of a dual mode atom - something that can function either as a donor or an
acceptor. An OH atom is the most common example.

Results are returned by placing isotopic labels on the atoms. By convention isotope
1 is applied for acceptors, isotope 3 for donors, and isotope 2 to atoms which
can function as either.

A typical use might be
```
donor_acceptor = DonorAcceptor()
for mol in mols:
  donor_acceptor.process(mol)
```
The `process` method returns the number of assignments made. Note that if an atom
is both acceptor and donor, it will count twice in the return code value.

## Speed Comparisons
One speed comparison is described in [tsubstructure](/docs/Workflows/substructure_comparison.md).
That shows excellent speed from LillyMol python, but in that case there was not much
actually being done in python.

A more meaningful test was something to detect 4-pyridol groups and transform them to
4-pyridone types. Running across all of Chembl, this took about 6.5 minutes. Having
found an algorithm that worked, that was translated to C++ and runs in 1 minute 15
seconds. 

So, in cases where most of the calculation is being done with python, speed
may be significantly diminished.

## Miscellaneous functions

### count_atoms_in_smiles
Many times the only need to instantiate a molecule is to get an atom count.
This function is text only, and makes, what is usually a very good, count of the
number of heavy atoms in a smiles.

### set_auto_create_new_elements
Allow creation of arbitrary elements
```
[Th][Eq][U]IC[K][Br]O[W]NFO[Xj][U][MP]SO[Ve][R][Th][E][La][Zy][D]O[G]
```
to be a valid smiles. Substructure search this with
```
[#{Th}][#{Eq}]...
``` 

### set_atomic_symbols_can_have_arbitrary_length
Allow molecules such as
```
[Ala][Gly][Arg][Ser]
```
again substructure searching is with `[#{Ala}D1]~[#{Gly}D2]...`.

### interpret_D_as_deuterium, interpret_T_as_deuterium
Elements `D` and `T` are interpreted as Hydrogen isotopes.
