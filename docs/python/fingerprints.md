# Fingerprints

New code should usually use the GFP bindings documented in
[LillyMolPython.md](LillyMolPython.md#gfp-fingerprint-files-and-similarity-search).
Those bindings expose `GFPContext`, `GFP`, `GFPFingerprint`, and `GFPList`, and
can generate and search LillyMol GFP fingerprints directly from Python.

The older helpers described later in this page remain available for compatibility
and for simple counted numpy-array fingerprint experiments, but they are not the
preferred interface for new fingerprint work.

## Recommended GFP API

Use `GFPContext` to define the fingerprint schema and generate standalone query
fingerprints:

```python
from lillymol import MolFromSmiles
from lillymol_tools import GFP, GFPContext, GFPList

mol = MolFromSmiles("c1ccccc1 benzene")
ctx = GFPContext.standard()
fp = ctx.fingerprint(mol)

print(ctx.distance(fp, fp))
```

Build a searchable collection with `GFPList`:

```python
gfp = GFPList.standard()

for smiles in ["CC ethane", "CCC propane", "CCCC butane"]:
  gfp.add(MolFromSmiles(smiles))

query = ctx.fingerprint(MolFromSmiles("CCC query"))
hits = gfp.nearest_neighbours(query, 3)

for hit in hits:
  print(hit.index, hit.distance)
```

Custom GFP schemas are built from immutable `GFP` specifications:

```python
ctx = GFPContext.from_specs([
    GFP.iw(),
    GFP.maccs(level2=True),
    GFP.mpr(),
    GFP.ec(radius=3, atom_type="UST:Z"),
])
```

See the GFP section of [LillyMolPython.md](LillyMolPython.md#gfp-fingerprint-files-and-similarity-search)
for the supported generators, file reading, metadata storage, and compatibility
rules between contexts.

## Similarity
There is no best similarity measure. The best similarity measure would
likely be one that accurately mapped to changes in Biological activity.
Much of Cheminformatics, and other, research is designed to find
means of accurately predicting similarity in Biological activity.
It is hard.

A good fingerprint might be the one that does the best at tracking
changes in Biological activity. That will likely be target dependent
and will need extensive study to identify.

A good fingerprint might be one that generally corresponds with human
perceptions of chemical similarity.

Our experience is that fingerprints like EC (Extended Connectivity, or Morgan)
fingerprints work best for things like SVM fingerprint models, linear
path fingerprints tend to work best for corresponding to human
perception. It all depends.

## Legacy Fingerprint Helpers

The following toy application shows a simple N*N nearest-neighbour
computation with the older `lillymol_fingerprint` helpers.
```
from absl import app
from absl import logging

from lillymol import *
from lillymol_io import *
from lillymol_fingerprint import *

def main(argv):
  if len(argv) == 1:
    logging.error("Must specify input file")

  mols = slurp(argv[1])
  logging.info("Read %d molecules from %s", len(mols), argv[1])

  fps = [linear_fingerprint(mol) for mol in mols]
  logging.info("Fingerprints generated")

  nfp = len(fps);
  for i in range(nfp):
    max_similarity = 0.0
    idmax = -1
    for j in range(nfp):
      if i == j:
        continue
      t = tanimoto(fps[i], fps[j])
      if t > max_similarity:
        max_similarity = t
        idmax = j

    print(f"{mols[i].smiles()} {mols[i].name()} {mols[idmax].smiles()} {mols[idmax].name()} {1.0 - max_similarity}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  app.run(main)
```
This does a very simple N*N nearest-neighbour computation. With some book-keeping
only half the calculations need to be performed. The example is retained because
it shows how the older counted numpy-array fingerprints work, but it is not the
recommended way to do nearest-neighbour searching in new code.

For larger collections, prefer `GFPList` and `GFPContext`. The GFP bindings use
the same binary and sparse fingerprint machinery as the LillyMol command-line GFP
tools, including efficient bit-vector similarity calculations.

The older counted helpers still have value when repeated features should
contribute directly to similarity. If a molecule contains four instances of a
feature, a binary fingerprint still sets one bit, whereas a counted fingerprint
records the number of instances and includes that count in the similarity
calculation.

Only linear fingerprints have a method for constructing fingerprints such as the above.
All fingerprints can work via a fingerprint generator, that can be configured with
things like atom typing.
```
  fpgen = LinearFingerprintCreator(2048)
  fpgen.set_max_length(7)
  fpgen.set_atom_type("UST:AY")

  fps = [fpgen.fingerprint(mol) for mol in mols]
  logging.info("Fingerprints generated")
```

For example to generate 1024 bit EC fingerprints, of radius 3, using an atom type of 'UST:AY' that
could be done by
```
  fpgen = ECFingerprintCreator(1024)
  fpgen.set_max_radius(3)
  fpgen.set_atom_type("UST:AY")

  fps = [fpgen.fingerprint(mol) for mol in mols]
```

Atom pair fingerprints are similar, this time restricting separations to 10 bonds.
```
  fpgen = AtomPairFingerprintCreator(1024)
  fpget.set_max_separation(10)
  fpgen.set_atom_type("UST:AY1")

  fps = [fpgen.fingerprint(mol) for mol in mols]
```
All generate numpy byte arrays, containing counted fingerprints.

For new similarity-search workflows, use the GFP API above. The legacy helpers
are best treated as compatibility functionality or as lower-level building
blocks for small experiments with counted numpy-array fingerprints.
